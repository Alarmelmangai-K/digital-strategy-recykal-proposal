# Recykal-app--Waste-Management
# Digital Strategic Business Initiative – Recykal

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a digital strategic business initiative designed to promote a circular economy through the digital transformation of waste management systems.

The proposal focuses on expanding Recykal’s existing B2B waste management platform into a unified, technology-driven ecosystem connecting waste generators, recyclers, logistics providers, and reuse startups.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Current waste management systems face challenges such as fragmented platforms, limited waste categories, lack of reuse mechanisms, inadequate logistics integration, and low community participation.

The existing solutions are largely B2B-focused and do not effectively address small-scale waste generation or global scalability.
